    "In 1930 Tolstoi, a Russian engineer, has to optimize the shipping of cement from factories to cities in the Soviet union through railway.\n",
    "\n",
    "* each factory produces a fixed number of tons\n",
    "\n",
    "* each city needs a fixed number of tons -- for now, we'll assume total production=total consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "* each factory is connected by rail with a few cities, and the corresponding distance is given\n",
    "\n",
    "* how to ship in order to minimize the total distance travelled?\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem belongs to the class of *min-cost flow problems*, an important class of linear programming problems, which are the focus of today's lecture. A decade before the invention of linear programming and the work of Kantorovich, Koopmans and Dantzig, Tolstoi described a heuristic method for solving the problem, which led to the optimal solution. As one can recover using modern tools, and will see that his solution was right.\n",
