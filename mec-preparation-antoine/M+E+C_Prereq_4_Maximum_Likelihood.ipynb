    "The Math+Econ+Code January masterclass is divided into an optimization-oriented part and an econometrics-oriented part. To understand well how to apply Optimal Transport to econometrics, some econometrics building blocks are absolutely essential, especially Logit theory. We will carefully study this topic to prepare you best.\n",

The chance is very low, actually close to 0. The chance/the **likelihood** that it has been generated by $\\mathcal{N}(82, 1)$ is much higher. Maximum likelihood allows us to formalize this idea through an optimization process.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you do OLS, you rely on the assumption that your the endogenous variable is normally distributed. This works fine most of the time, but sometimes this assumption is not realistic. Poisson regression is used to model situations where the endogenous variable is $(i)$ discrete and $(ii)$ positive. The typical example is the number of visits to the doctor that an individual makes per year. A lot of people only go once a year, a bit less go twice a year, very few go more than 6 times a year. Nobody goes -2 times a year. Therefore this process is better approximated by a Poisson distribution than a normal distribution. Although OLS would give some results, the Poisson assumption more suited to the nature of the process we want to model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Logit is a tool at the basis of discrete choice models. We live in a discrete world: when you choose a level of insurance or an airplane ticket, you choose between basic, premium, elite, or whatever the name is. If you want to go from Paris to London, you need to choose between airplane, train, boat, car or swimming. What drives your choice ? Probably comfort, speed, and price, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may know already, OLS is unfit for modelling this type of process. Let us say that you can only choose between plane ($y_i = 1$) or train ($y_i = 0$). For any explanatory variable $x$, we are looking for the probability P($y_i = 1 | x$). OLS doesn't know that we are looking for a probability, so it may give probability $> 1$ or $< 0$, which doesn't make sense. For this reason the logit framework is more appropriated than OLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logit relies on an important concept which is unobserved heterogeneity: it can be understood as the \"things\" that make a given alternative more or less desirable, but that we cannot observe it in the data. For example, if you study the market for chairs, it may be easy to observe the material used, but much less easy to observe the level of comfort.\n",
    "\n",
    "For logit, the distributional assumption of this unobserved heterogeneity is that it is distributed following the Gumbel distribution. It is also called Extreme Value Type 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF of this distribution is the following: $F(\\epsilon) = e^{-e^{-\\epsilon}}$"
