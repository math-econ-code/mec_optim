The core result that should be the first step of every optimization problem is the Weierstrass Theorem.\n",

Reminder: in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, an open ball of finite radius $r$ is a circle centered on $(0, 0)$. A set $Y$ is then said to be **closed** if its complement $Y^c = \\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus Y$ is open. Using this definition, $[0, 1]$ is closed, while $(0, 1)$ is open. Particular cases, the sets $\\emptyset$ and $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are both open and closed sets. Thus they possess the properties we are looking for. \n",

If, for a circle with radius large enough, you can fit the set inside the ball, then your set is bounded. For example, $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$ is a bounded set, while $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is not.

    "#### Duality\n",
    "This presentation is heavily inspired by [\"Convex Optimization\"](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) (Boyd Vandenberghe). The authors have made their book available online, so you should not hesitate to take a look at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what is duality ? A perspective on optimization problems that yields interesting results when we apply it to topics studied in the masterclass (optimal assignment problems).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every optimization problem can be studied from two different perspectives: the primal and the dual. So far, we have exclusively adopted the perspective of solving the **primal** problem. But any problem could be rewritten in another form, through the Lagrangian. Duality can be used for any optimization problems, but the interesting thing about the **dual** of LP problems (and **convex** optimization problems in general, is that the solution of the dual and the primal coincide if it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that even when the primal is nonconvex (and therefore hard to solve), the dual will be convex. Although the solutions do not coincide then, the value of the dual provides a lower bound on the optimal value of the primal."
