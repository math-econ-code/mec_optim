    "In 1987, a paper by Rust introduced in a concise and understandable manner the estimation of dynamic discrete choice processes. So far, we have done static Discrete Choice, where an individual's choice is completely described by the alternatives available. Here, every choice has consequences on the future. Therefore, modelling of the individual's behaviour will combine dynamic programming and discrete choice models. Fortunately, knowing both tools, you are perfectly able to estimate the structural parameters in a dynamic discrete choice problem."
