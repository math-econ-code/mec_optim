    "## Introduction and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "A dynamic programming problem is an optimization problem in which decisions are taken sequentially over several time periods (Sundaram).\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a dynamic optimization problem arises when actions today have consequences tomorrow. You have probably solved dynamic programming problems already, at least in problems with a finite horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specificity of DP problems is that they are set up in discrete time. Time is index with $t = 1,2,3...,T/\\infty$. Two main subtypes of DP problems exist:\n",
    "* Finite-Horizon Dynamic Programming (FHDP), in which time stops at $T < \\infty$\n",
    "* Infinite-Horizon/Stationary Dynamic Programming (SDP), in which the agents plans as if she were immortal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many interesting problems (such as matching), have a dynamic counterpart. Modelling, solving or estimating such problems leads in itself to technical and intellectual challenges. You should have a good understanding of dynamic programming to tackle any graduate macroeconomics class."

    "\n",
    "$u_t$ is the decision, called the **control** of the agent. It belongs to a set $U$. For example, in the consumption problem we are about to describe, $u$ represents consumption, and it cannot be higher than the total amount of resource available (if we exclude credit of course).\n",

    "Given the assumption that $x_t$ contains all necessary information, it should be possible, at any $t$, to define by $V(x_t)$ the **value** of being at $x$, at $t$.

Then, you go one day before and solve for $u_{T-1}^*$ by optimizing as shown. This process of moving backwards in time to solve a sequential problem is called **backwards induction**.\n"

    "How to interpret this ? The blue line describes, for each $k_t$ on the horizontal axis, what should be the optimal $k_{t+1}$. When both coincide, this is the steady state: it gives the equilibrium value of capital $k^*$. The algorithm we used, VFI, is a type of a **fixed-point** algorithm. We started from a random $Vk0$ (which is not the blue line !) and computed present values pretending $Vk0$ was $V(k')$. Then, we looked at where the present values are the highest (optimization process) for every $k$ (line 36), and replaced our random $VkV0$ by that optimized $V(k')$. Of course it's still wrong, but if we repeat this procedure enough times, we can get arbitrarily close the the true $V(k')$."

    "Dynamic Programming also has a stochastic extension, in which the state transition involves probabilities. In such settings, the number of possible states can very quickly explode and become intractable: that's called the **curse of dimensionality**. Algorithms from the Artificial Intelligence literature are strongly connected to the ones we presented here (think of the position of pieces on the chess board as being the state, and the control as being the move that can be made by the chess player).\n",
