    "* Each food has a unit cost, and the problem is to find the optimal diet = combination of foods that meet the minimal intake in each of the nutrients and achieves minimal cost\n",

    "The problem was taken on by G. Stigler, who published a paper about it in 1945, giving a first heuristic solution, exhibiting a diet that costs $\\$39.93$ per year in $1939$ dollars. Later (in $1947$) it was one of the first\n",

But later on, we shall deal with problem with hundreds of thousands of variables or constraints, and the choice of the right linear programming solver will become crucial.\n",

[Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/), also a commercial solver with a free academic license, is among the best performers, and widely available in Python, R, C++ and many other languages. We shall use it as our linear programming solver of choice for the entirety of this course. \n",
