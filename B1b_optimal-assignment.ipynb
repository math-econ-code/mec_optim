    "Consider the problem of assigning a possibly infinite number of workers\n",
    "and firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each worker should work for one firm, and each firm should hire one worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Workers and firms have heterogenous characteristics; let $x\\in \\mathcal{X}$ and $y\\in\\mathcal{Y}$ be the characteristics of workers and firms respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Workers and firms are in equal mass, which is normalized to one. Both worker's types and firm's types have a distribution on $\\mathcal{X}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}$ which is assumed known.\n",

    "It is assumed that if a worker $x$ matches with a firm $y$, the total output generated is $\\Phi_{xy}$. The questions are then:\n",

    "* **Optimality:** what is the optimal assignment in the sense that it maximizes the overal output generated?\n",
