    "John Rust describes the problem of Harold Zurcher, an engineer who runs a bus fleet as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* each month, buses operate a stochastic number of miles\n",
    "\n",
    "* operations costs increase with mileage (maintenance, fuel, insurance and costs of unexpected breakdowns)\n",
    "\n",
    "* there is a fixed cost associated with overhaul (independent on mileage)\n",
    "\n",
    "* each month, Zurcher needs to decide to send the bus to overhaul, which resets their mileage to zero, or to let them operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a *dynamic programming problem*. When taking the decision whether to perform the overhaul or not, Zurcher needs to compare the operation cost not only with the cost of overhaul, but also take into account the reduction in operation costs in the future periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "While in this instance of the problem there is no externality across buses, so the buses could decide in isolation whether to go on maintenance or not, it is not hard to envision a variant of this problem where there are externalities. For instance, one may assume that there is a maximum number of buses that can go on overhaul at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall derive the optimal policy for Harold Zurcher, (somewhat freely) based on Rust's data."
